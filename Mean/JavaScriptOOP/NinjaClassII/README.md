# Ninja Class II

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Add a new method to Ninja called .punch(). This method will take another Ninja instance and subtract 5 Health from the Ninja we passed in. Your .punch() should display a console message like the below example.

2. Now add a method to your Ninja class called .kick(). Kick will subtract 15 Health for each point of Strength the calling Ninja has, and  .punch() will take another Ninja instance.
