# Gamify

A project that expands on objects and pointers.

This project completes the following tasks:

1. Add an attribute to the player to track whether the player has honey or not

2. Create a mission function so that the user is given a destination

3. Create a pickUp function that changes the player's honey status to true if it is invoked when the player is at the bees' location

4. Create a drop function that allows the player to deliver honey to the proper destination
