# Braces Valid
This project performs the following tasks:

1. Use of data structures (arrays, objects) effectively

2. Given a string, write a function that will determine whether the braces  - including parentheses (), square brackets [], and curly brackets {} - within the string are valid. That means that any braces within other braces must close before the outer set closes.

                Example Example: bracesValid("{{()}}[]") returns true because the inner braces close before the outer braces. 
                Each opening brace has a matching closing brace.

                Example: bracesValid("{(})") returns false because the curly braces close before the parentheses, which starts 
                within the curly braces, had a chance to close.
