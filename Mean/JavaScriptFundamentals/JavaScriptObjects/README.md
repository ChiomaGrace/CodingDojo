# JavaScript Objects

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Iterating over arrays and objects.

2. Challenge 1: Write a function that accepts an array of student objects, as shown below. Print all of the students' names and their cohorts.

```javascript
let students = [
    {name: 'Remy', cohort: 'Jan'},
    {name: 'Genevieve', cohort: 'March'},
    {name: 'Chuck', cohort: 'Jan'},
    {name: 'Osmund', cohort: 'June'},
    {name: 'Nikki', cohort: 'June'},
    {name: 'Boris', cohort: 'June'}
];
```
        Your console should look like the following when the function is called with the provided array.

                Name: Remy, Cohort: Jan
                Name: Genevieve, Cohort: March
                Name: Chuck, Cohort: Jan
                Name: Osmund, Cohort: June
                Name: Nikki, Cohort: June
                Name: Boris, Cohort: June
