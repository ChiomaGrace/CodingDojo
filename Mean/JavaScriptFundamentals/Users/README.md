# Users

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Familiarity with moving through JavaScript objects to find relevant data.

2. Essential practice for when we need to sift through data we get from an API.

3. Write a function called userLanguages that accepts an array of users, such as the one shown above. Return a string that lists all the users by first name and last name and the languages that each user knows. Make the string as nicely formatted as possible so that it is easy to read.
    * Example: userLanguages(users) returns
