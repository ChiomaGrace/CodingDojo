# EJS Cat Data

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Create an application that shows all the cats on /cats and make all the images clickable

2. Clicking an image of a cat should navigate to a unique route in the server, which may be hardcoded

3. Each of the cat's unique routes should render the same template and pass it data about that cat. This data may be hardcoded in the server.

4. Display the data about the cat in the template

5. Include at least one array in the cat's data and iterate over it in the template with ejs
