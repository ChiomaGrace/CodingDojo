# EJS Cars and Cats

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Have '/cars' show your pictures of cars.

2. Have '/cats' show your pictures of cats.

3. Have 'cars/new' show a form to create a new car. The form does not have to do anything yet.

4. Keep your index.html file in the static directory. It should render even when your server does not explicitly handle the '/' route
