# Lion

This project practices Object Oriented Programming in Ruby.

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Have the default health be 170

2. Add a new method called fly, which when invoked, decreases the health by 10.

3. Add a new method called attack_town, which when invoked, decreases the health by 50.

4. Add a new method called eat_humans, which when invoked, increases the health by 20.

5. Have the Lion attack_town three times, eat_humans twice, fly twice, and have it display its health. When the Lion's display_health method is called have it say 'This is a lion` before it displays the default information (make sure you still call the parent's display_health function).
