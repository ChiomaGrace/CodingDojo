# Human

This project practices Object Oriented Programming in Ruby.

This project performs the following tasks:

1. The human class should have 4 attributes: strength, intelligence, stealth, and health.

2. Give the human a default value of 3 for strength, stealth and intelligence. Health should have a default value of 100.

3. Add a new method called attack, which when invoked, should attack another object (i.e., decrease its health) if the object it is attacking inherits from the Human class. Hint: you can check ancestors of a object by using .class.ancestors
