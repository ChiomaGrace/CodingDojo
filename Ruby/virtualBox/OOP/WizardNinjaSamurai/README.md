3. Wizard should have a method called fireball, which when invoked, decrease the health of whichever object it attacked by 20

4. Ninja should have a default stealth of 175

5. Ninja should have a steal method which, when invoked, attacks an object and increases the Ninjas health by 10

6. Ninja should have a get_away method which, when invoked, decreases its health by 15

7. Samurai should have a default health of 200

8. Samurai should have method called death_blow, which when invoked, attacks an object and decreases its health to 0

9. Samurai should have a method called meditate, which when invoked, heals the Samurai back to full health

10. Samurai should have a class method called how_many, which when invoked, displays how many Samurai's there are
