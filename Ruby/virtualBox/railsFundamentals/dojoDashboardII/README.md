# Dojo Dashboard II

This project practices using models with controllers, and it expands on the Dojo Dashboard project with more features.

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Create a page with a form where someone can create a new dojo. The url should be "/dojos/new" routing to "dojos#new". 

2. Validate the form and display necessary error messages if the form is invalid. Otherwise, display a success message that says the form was submitted.

3. Make sure that the information gets posted to "/dojos". The create method in the Dojos controller should process the information, pass necessary information back to appropriate methods/views and if validation worked, create a new record in the dojos table.
