# Blogs, Posts, and Messages II with Comments (Polymorphism)

This project practices familiarity with tables/models and expands on the Blogs, Posts, and Messages II project.

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Add a new model to the previous assignment where now a model called Comment can take comments for a user, blog, post, or a message.

2. Test using the console and make sure it allows you to add, update, delete comments for a user, blog, post, and a message.
