# Layout Assignment

This project practices using models with controllers and incorporating a layout.

This project performs the following tasks:

1. Create 2 separate layout files, two_column.html.erb and three_column.html.erb.

2. Create two controllers called Users and Posts

3. For each controller, create a index method and the appropriate view file.

4. Have the UsersController index method use the two column layout
* One side of the column should have a table that displays all the users in your database
* The other side should have a form to create a new user and a link to "/posts"

5. Have the PostsController index method use the three column layout 
* This first third should have a table that displays all the posts
* The middle third should have a form to create a new post
* The last third should have a h1 tag and a link to go to the users page
