# Guess the Number

This project practices the understanding of conditional tests.

The method will be called guess_number, and the input will be the guess. There will be three possible outcomes to this method:

* The user guessed correctly, return "You got it!"
* The guess was too high, return "Guess was too high!"
* The guess was too low, return "Guess was too low!"
