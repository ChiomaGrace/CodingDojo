# Dojo Survey
This project practices creating a server with Flask from scratch, adding routes to a Flask app, having the client send data to the server with a form, and having the server render a template using data provided by the client.

This project completes the following tasks:

1. Create a new Flask application

2. Have the root route ("/") show a page with the form

3. Have the "/result" route display the information from the form on a new HTML page
