# Semi-Restful TV Shows with Validations

This project adds validations to the existing Semi-Restful TV Shows project.

This project completes the following tasks:

1. Validate the Add a TV Show form to ensure all fields are populated appropriately before adding to the database.

2. Display errors on the Add a TV Show form if the information is invalid.

3. Validate the Edit Show form with the same validations as creation.
Display errors on the Edit Show form if the information is invalid.

4. NINJA BONUS: Ensure the Release Date is in the past.

5. NINJA BONUS: Allow the description to be optional. If a description is provided, though, it should still be at least 10 characters.

6. SENSEI BONUS: Validate that a TV show with that title does not already exist in the database before creating or updating.
