# Login and Registration Form

This project practices implementing flash messages and sessions in creating a login and registration webpage with validations.

This project completes the following tasks:

1. Create a new Django project with a login app

2. Have the root route render a page where users can register or log in

3. Complete the registration method, including showing errors if the input is invalid

4. Complete the login method, including showing errors if the input is invalid

5. Upon successful registration or login, redirect to a success page, displaying the user's name and a message as shown above

6. Have the logout link clear the session and redirect to the login/reg page
Don't allow a user who is not logged in to reach the /success route (i.e. by making a GET request in the address bar)

7. NINJA BONUS: Add a birthday field and validate that the user's birthday is in the past

8. NINJA BONUS: Validate that the email provided for registration is unique

9. SENSEI BONUS: Add a birthday field and validate that the user is at least 13 years old (COPPA compliant!)
