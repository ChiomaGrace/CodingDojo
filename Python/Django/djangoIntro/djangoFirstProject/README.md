# First Django Project

This project practices setting up a new Django project, setting up a new Django app, routing in Django, increases familiarity with views, and reviews rendering a simple HttpResponse.

This project completes the following tasks:

1. Create a new project with a single app

2. / - display the string "placeholder to later display a list of all blogs" with a method named "index"

3. /new - display the string "placeholder to display a new form to create a new blog" with a method named "new"

4. /create - redirect to the "/" route with a method called "create"

5. /< number > - display the string "placeholder to display blog number: {number}" with a method named "show" (eg. localhost:8000/15 should display the message: 'placeholder to display blog number 15')

6. /< number >/edit - display the string "placeholder to edit blog {number}" with a method named "edit"

7. /< number >/delete - redirect to the "/" route with a method called "destroy"
